- title: Churn Modeling with XGBoost
  label: churn
  short_description: Build an XGBoost model to predict churn using customer telco data.
  long_description: >-
    This project demonstrates how to build a classifier model (Logistic
    Regression, Xgboost) to predict the churn probability for a group of
    customers from a telecoms company. In addition, the model can then be
    interpreted using LIME. Both the classifier  and LIME models are then
    deployed using CML's real-time model deployment capability. Finally, a basic
    flask application is deployed that will let you interact with the real-time
    model to see which factors in the data have the most influence on the churn
    probability.

- title: Structural Time Series
  label: structural-time-series
  short_description: Applying Bayesian STS to California hourly electricity demand data.
  long_description: >-
    This project provides an example application of generalized additive models
    (via the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand data. The
    primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a
    probablistic forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic question
    against it.
